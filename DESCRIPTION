Description: A tool for generating synthetic data. The key objective of this package is to aid developers in generating synthetic data with a special focus on visualization. 
    There are instances when developers build an analytical framework as a proof of concept or a working prototype. However, in order to demonstrate the capability of this framework, one needs to have data. Furthermore, this data needs to be as realistic as possible. This package attempts to provide the tools needed to build such a synthetic data.
