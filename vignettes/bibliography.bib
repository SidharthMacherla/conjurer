Estimates of the model parameters imply that at least half of the quarterly innovation in U. S. economic activity can be attributed to a stationary cyclical component that persists over periods of time as long as five years. This finding is inconsistent with the hypothesis that most of the apparent variation in U. S. economic activity can be attributed to a nonstationary trend component.}",

    abstract = { The work presented in this article constitutes a contribution to modeling and forecasting the demand in a food company, by using time series approach. Our work demonstrates how the historical demand data could be utilized to forecast future demand and how these forecasts affect the supply chain. The historical demand information was used to develop several autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models by using Box–Jenkins time series procedure and the adequate model was selected according to four performance criteria: Akaike criterion, Schwarz Bayesian criterion, maximum likelihood, and standard error. The selected model corresponded to the ARIMA (1, 0, 1) and it was validated by another historical demand information under the same conditions. The results obtained prove that the model could be utilized to model and forecast the future demand in this food manufacturing. These results will provide to managers of this manufacturing reliable guidelines in making decisions. }

abstract = {Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them
is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called k-anonymity
has gained popularity. In a k-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable
from at least k − 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes.In
this article, we show using two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has some
subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of
sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes.
This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we
show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background
knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel
and powerful privacy criterion called ℓ-diversity that can defend against such attacks.
In addition to building a formal foundation for ℓ-diversity, we show in an experimental
evaluation that ℓ-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},
